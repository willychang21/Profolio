# Introduction

The previous iteration of my personal website was based on a forked template, making modifications and the addition of new features challenging. To address these limitations and better align the site with my evolving needs, I have decided to develop a new website from scratch.

## Build with

- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: TanStack Router
- **Markdown Parsing**: react-markdown
- **Deploy & Analytics**: Vercel

## Feature

1. **Responsive Design**: The website supports all platforms for optimal viewing on any device.
2. **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
3. **Markdown Content Management**: Easily manage and edit content using Markdown.
