# Introduce

Our project introduces a hybrid checkpointing approach for serverless computing, effectively reducing orchestration costs by up to 25% while adhering to strict service level objectives (SLOs). By integrating in-memory data stores with on-disk systems, we optimize performance and minimize latency, enhancing the efficiency of complex, event-driven applications.
