# Introduction

This research project explores the scalability, throughput, and latency of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) managed via OpenFlow and traditional OSPF networks. Employing Mininet for network emulation and the Ryu controller for SDN management, our study aims to provide a comprehensive performance comparison to gauge SDN's viability in real-world applications.
